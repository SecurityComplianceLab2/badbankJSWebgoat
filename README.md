# BadBank-three-tier
BadBank application with front-end, back-end, and database. This project was created in my effort to learn how to build a complete 3-tier application and it will continue to grow as my knowledge of application development grows. It is designed to be an easy way to show off things I'm learning in my Master's Full Stack Development program.

Start with a git clone to your own machine. In the file directory, start by entering the following command in your command line "npm install". This program requires the latest version of Node.js to run. Then run the following in the command line "node index.js", this starts the server. navigate to localhost:3000 to begin.
